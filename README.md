# Memory-Game
=============

This is a complete browser-based card matching game.

In Each turn: 

* Click to start the game.
* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying image.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same image.
* If the cards match, both cards will dance together.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped back images.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched, then you win the game.
